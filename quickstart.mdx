## Create your first embed

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an Amazon product">

    ```
    https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the embed">
    Use the dashboard or API to create your first embed card:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST https://jasin.app/api/embeds \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "amazon_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW",
        "theme": "light"
      }'
    ```
    
    ```javascript JavaScript
    const response = await fetch('https://jasin.app/api/embeds', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        amazon_url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW',
        theme: 'light'
      })
    });
    
    const embed = await response.json();
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed on your website">
    Copy the generated HTML code and paste it into your website:
    
    ```html
    <div id="jasin-embed-123" class="jasin-embed">
      <!-- Product card HTML -->
    </div>
    <script src="https://jasin.app/embed.js"></script>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
