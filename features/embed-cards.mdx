## Overview

Jasin transforms Amazon product URLs into clean, beautiful product cards that you can embed on any
website. Simply paste an Amazon link, customize the appearance, and get a script tag to embed
anywhere.

## Creating Embed Cards

### From the Dashboard or My Products Page

1. **Sign in** to your Jasin dashboard at [getjasin.com](https://getjasin.com)
2. **Click the "Add Product" button** - This opens a modal to add a new product
3. **Paste Amazon URL** - Copy any Amazon product URL into the input field

5. **Choose theme** - Select light or dark theme
6. **Save** - Click the "Save" button to save the product
7. **Copy the embed code** - Use the script tag anywhere you want the product card to appear

### What You Get When Creating an Embed Card

Each embed generates a simple script tag like this:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js"
  data-id="2d19689e-d85c-4837-b747-84f5e18c34c8"

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Script loads** - The embed.js script loads asynchronously
2. **Card renders** - Product data is fetched and the card is displayed
3. **Tracking starts** - View tracking begins when the card is visible
4. **Click tracking** - Clicks are tracked when users click through to Amazon

### Performance

- **Lazy loading** - Cards only load when they're about to be visible
- **Cached data** - Product information is cached for fast loading
- **Minimal footprint** - Small script size for fast page loads
- **No dependencies** - Works without jQuery or other libraries

### Compatibility

- **All modern browsers** - Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile responsive** - Optimized for phones and tablets
