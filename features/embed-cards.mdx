## Common Use Cases

### Blog Posts
Perfect for product recommendations within your blog content:

```html
<p>I've been using this coffee maker for months and absolutely love it:</p>

<script 
  async 
  src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js" 
  data-id="coffee-maker-embed"
  data-theme="light">

<p>The programmable features make my mornings so much easier!</p>

### Product Reviews

```html
<h2>Our Top Pick: Best Wireless Headphones</h2>

<script 
  async 
  src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js" 
  data-id="headphones-embed"
  data-theme="auto">
</script>

<p>After testing 15 different models, these headphones stood out...</p>
```

### Comparison Posts
Use multiple embeds to compare products:

```html
<h3>Budget Option</h3>
<script async src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js" data-id="budget-option"></script>

<h3>Premium Choice</h3>
<script async src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js" data-id="premium-option"></script>
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Script loads** - The embed.js script loads asynchronously
2. **Card renders** - Product data is fetched and the card is displayed
3. **Tracking starts** - View tracking begins when the card is visible
4. **Click tracking** - Clicks are tracked when users click through to Amazon

### Performance
- **Lazy loading** - Cards only load when they're about to be visible
- **Cached data** - Product information is cached for fast loading
- **Minimal footprint** - Small script size for fast page loads
- **No dependencies** - Works without jQuery or other libraries

### Compatibility
- **All modern browsers** - Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile responsive** - Optimized for phones and tablets
- **CMS friendly** - Works with WordPress, Squarespace, Ghost, and more
- **Email compatible** - Can be used in HTML emails (with limitations)

## Analytics & Tracking

Every embed automatically tracks:
- **Views** - When the product card is displayed
- **Clicks** - When users click through to Amazon
- **Performance** - Click-through rates and engagement

View detailed analytics in your dashboard to see which products perform best.
