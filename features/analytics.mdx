## Tracking Implementation

### Automatic Tracking

The embed script automatically tracks views and clicks:

```html
<!-- Jasin embed script (automatically generates the card) -->
<script
  async
  src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js"
  data-id="2d19689e-d85c-4837-b747-84f5e18c34c8"
  data-theme="light"
  data-show-badge="true"
></script>
```

### View Tracking

Views are tracked when:

- The embed card becomes visible in the viewport
- Uses Intersection Observer API for accuracy
- Beacon API for reliable tracking (with fetch fallback)

### Click Tracking

Clicks are tracked through:

- Redirect URLs that log the click before sending to Amazon
- Preserves affiliate tags and tracking parameters
- Works with all Amazon product links
