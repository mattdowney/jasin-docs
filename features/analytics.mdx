## Tracking Implementation

### Automatic Tracking
The embed script automatically tracks views and clicks:

```html
<!-- Embed card HTML -->
<div id="jasin-embed-abc123" class="jasin-embed">
  <!-- Product card content -->
</div>

<!-- Tracking script (required) -->
<script src="https://getjasin.com/embed.js"></script>
```

### View Tracking
Views are tracked when:
- The embed card becomes visible in the viewport
- Uses Intersection Observer API for accuracy
- Beacon API for reliable tracking (with fetch fallback)

### Click Tracking
Clicks are tracked through:
- Redirect URLs that log the click before sending to Amazon
- Preserves affiliate tags and tracking parameters
- Works with all Amazon product links
