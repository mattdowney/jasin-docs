### Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do prices show in USD instead of my local currency?">
    Jasin displays prices in USD because we use Amazon's US marketplace to ensure proper affiliate tracking. When you click through to Amazon, you'll see prices converted to your local currency during checkout. This is normal behavior that ensures our affiliate partnerships work correctly.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do my existing embeds stop working if I downgrade?">
  No, your existing embeds will continue to work normally even if you downgrade from Pro to Free.
  However, you won't be able to create new embeds until you upgrade again or wait for your next
  monthly credit renewal.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own Amazon affiliate tag?">
    Yes! Pro and Pro Plus users can add their own Amazon affiliate tag in the dashboard settings to earn commissions directly. Free users use our default affiliate tag to help support the service.
