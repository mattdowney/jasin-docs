## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to unused credits?">
    Credits refresh monthly on paid plans. Unused credits don't roll over to the next month, so use them within the billing period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change plans anytime?">
    Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Changes take effect immediately, and we'll prorate any billing adjustments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do my embeds stop working if I downgrade?">
    No, your existing embeds will continue to work normally. However, you won't be able to create new embeds until you have available credits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are custom affiliate tags?">
    Pro and Pro Plus users can use their own Amazon affiliate tags to earn commissions directly from clicks on their product cards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does bot filtering work?">
    Our advanced bot detection filters out non-human traffic from your analytics, giving you more accurate view and click data. This feature is available on Pro and Pro Plus plans.
